# MachineLearning
This repository contains the final project for the Machine Learning Course at Soft Uni.
The project is in file `Course_Project.ipynb`
The Dataset can be downloaded from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/download/train.csv
The following files are the trained models. They can be loaded later in the Jupyter notebook to save the training time:
* `KNeighborsClassifier-BACKUP.sav` - as the name suggests this is the K-Neighbors Classifier model
* `LogisticRegression-BACKUP.sav` - Logistic Regression model
* `SVC-BACKUP.sav` - Gaussian SVM model
* `test_set-BACKUP.sav` -  contains the test set saved as an object
